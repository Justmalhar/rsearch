# rSearch: AI-Powered Reasoning Engine

![rSearch](https://rsearch.app/og.png)


A cutting-edge research assistant powered by artificial intelligence that harnesses the advanced reasoning capabilities of [DeepSeek R1](https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1) combined with comprehensive internet search functionality. **rSearch** delivers precise, well-reasoned responses to complex research queries by:

- Leveraging state-of-the-art language models for refining queries
- Performing intelligent web searches across multiple data sources
- Synthesizing information through sophisticated chain-of-thought reasoning processes
- Providing clear, actionable insights backed by reliable sources

## Overview

**rSearch** leverages [DeepSeek's Reasoner - R1 model](https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1) to perform Chain-of-Thought reasoning on search results. The platform first refines your query, searches the internet using [Serper.dev](https://serper.dev) API, and then applies advanced reasoning to synthesize a comprehensive, well-thought-out response. Built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), it offers a seamless research experience while maintaining high performance and code quality.

### AI Models and Reasoning

    SERPER_API_KEY=

    # DeepSeek API Key (AI Provider) - https://platform.deepseek.com/api_keys
    NEXT_PUBLIC_DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=

    # DeepSeek Base URL (AI Provider)
    NEXT_PUBLIC_DEEPSEEK_BASE_URL=https://api.deepseek.com

    # DeepSeek Refiner Model (AI Provider)
    NEXT_PUBLIC_DEEPSEEK_REFINER_MODEL=deepseek-chat

    # DeepSeek Reasoning Model (AI Provider)
    NEXT_PUBLIC_DEEPSEEK_REASONING_MODEL=deepseek-reasoner
    ```

5. Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    ```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`
